To install the _Production_ version locally, please follow to our\n> [standard installation guides](/getting-started/installation/).\n\n::: tip Minimum Requirements\n\nYou will need to have [the latest version of Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) to _build_ a Development\nversion of Directus.\n\n:::\n\n## 1. Fork the Directus repository\n\nGo to the [repository](https://github.com/directus/directus) and fork it to your GitHub account. A fork is your copy of\nthe Directus repository. Forking the repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the\noriginal project.\n\n## 2. Clone from your repository\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/directus.git\n```\n\n## 3. Make a new branch\n\n```bash\ngit checkout -b YOUR-BRANCH-NAME\n```\n\n## 4. Install the dependencies and build the project\n\n```bash\nnpm install\nnpm run build\n```\n\n## 5. Create a `.env` file\n\nCreate a `.env` file under the `api` folder. You can use the `example.env` file provided under `api` as a starting\npoint.\n\n```bash\n# To use the example file\ncp api/example.env api/.env\n```\n\n## 6. Initialize the database\n\nFor this step, you'll need to already have a SQL database up-and-running, except if you're using the SQLite driver,\nwhich will create the database (file) for you.\n\nTo start the initialization run the following command:\n\n```bash\n# From within the root of the project\nnpm run cli bootstrap\n\n# For SQLite you need to be in the 'api' folder to initialize the database\ncd api\nnpm run cli bootstrap\n```\n\nThis will set-up the required tables for Directus and make sure all the migrations have run.\n\n## 7. Start the development server\n\nRun the following command from the root directory.\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nIf you are only looking to work on the Documentation (public website version), you can navigate to the `docs` directory\nand run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev:site\n```\n\n::: tip\n\nIf you encounter errors during this installation process, make sure your node version meets the\n[minimum requirements](/guides/installation/cli)\n\n:::\n\n## 8. Make your fixes/changes\n\nAt this point you are ready to start working on Directus! Before diving in however, it's worth reading through the\nintroduction to [Contributing](/contributing/introduction).\n"}}]);
